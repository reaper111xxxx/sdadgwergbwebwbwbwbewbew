         <p>   
            I don’t think I say this enough, but you mean everything to me. Life just feels better with you in it—like everything makes a little more sense when you’re around. Whether we’re talking for hours or just for five minutes, there’s no one else I’d rather spend my time with.

            you make the good moments even better and the bad ones easier to get through. I love you.., how you notice the little details no one else does, and how just being near you makes everything feel right.
            
            I’m not perfect and neither is life but I know one thing for sure I want to go through it all with you. no over the top promises just me here choosing you, every single day.
